# ERC20 Token Program 

This project is a simple implementation of an ERC20 token using Solidity smart contracts.

## Overview

The project consists of a Solidity smart contract that implements the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token contract allows users to transfer tokens between accounts, query token balances, and approve token allowances.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Compile the Solidity smart contract using your preferred development environment.
4. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your preferred blockchain network.
5. Update the contract address and ABI in the JavaScript files.
6. Run the JavaScript files using Node.js to interact with the smart contract.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract code for the ERC20 token.
- `scripts/`: Contains JavaScript files for interacting with the deployed ERC20 token contract.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## Usage

After deploying the ERC20 token smart contract, you can use the provided JavaScript files to interact with it. Make sure to update the contract address and ABI in the JavaScript files before running them.
